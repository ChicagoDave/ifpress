ifpress is a content management system designed specifically for web based inform 7 stories compiled in Glulx using custom Inform 7 extensions and fyrevm-web.

fyrevm-web is a major prerequisite to building ifpress and will be in beta for at least until 2018. Once fyrevm-web has solid templates and components, at least two well-designed and implemented published stories, work on ifpress will begin.
